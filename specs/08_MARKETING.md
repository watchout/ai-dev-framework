## Part 1: Strategy Design

### 1.1 Strategy of Preeminence (Jay Abraham)

Treat customers as "clients" (protected partners, not transaction counterparts). Give value before selling. Customer success = your success.

| Phase | Application |
|-------|------------|
| LP | Provide educational content before selling |
| Beta | Build trust through free value |
| Paid | Price design committed to customer success |

### 1.2 Three Growth Axes

```
Revenue = Customers x Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency

+10% each axis -> 1.33x revenue
+25% each axis -> 1.95x revenue (~2x)
```

| Axis | Tactics |
|------|---------|
| **Customers** | LP, SNS, ads, conversion optimization, referral programs |
| **Order Value** | Upsell (premium plans), cross-sell (related services), value-based pricing |
| **Frequency** | Onboarding improvement, email/reminders, habit integration |

### 1.3 USP Design

```
[Target] chooses us over [competitors/alternatives]
because we provide [unique value].
The reason: [credible evidence].
```

Checklist: clearly different from competitors / important to customer / explainable in one sentence / provable (results, data, guarantee)

### 1.4 Risk Reversal (Jay Abraham)

| Level | Content | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Basic guarantee | 30-day refund |
| 2 | Conditional guarantee | Full refund if no results |
| 3 | Enhanced guarantee | Refund + $100 if unsatisfied |
| 4 | Outcome guarantee | Support until results achieved |

## Part 2: Copywriting

### 2.1 PASONA Formula (Masanori Kanda)

```
P - Problem     : Clarify customer pain
A - Agitation   : Show consequences of inaction
S - Solution    : Present the solution
O - Offer       : Present specific offer
N - Narrow      : Create urgency to act now
A - Action      : Prompt specific action
```

**LP Section Mapping**:

| Section | PASONA | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Headline | P | "Are you struggling with...?" |
| Problem | A | "If you leave this alone..." |
| Solution | S | "[Product] solves this" |
| Features/Benefits | O | "Specifically..." |
| Scarcity | N | "Beta limited to 100 users" |
| CTA | A | "Register now" |

### 2.2 Emotional Triggers (Neuromarketing)

| Trigger | Copy Example |
|---------|-------------|
| Fear | "You'll lose to competitors at this rate" |
| Desire | "Achieve your ideal state" |
| Scarcity | "Only 3 spots left" |
| Urgency | "Until 23:59 today" |
| Social proof | "1,000 companies adopted" |
| Authority | "Recommended by Prof. X" |
| Affinity | "I had the same problem" |
| Consistency | "Exclusive for free registrants" |

### 2.3 Brain-Targeted Copy Principles

**Appeal to reptilian brain first** (survival, pleasure-seeking, pain-avoidance), then emotions, then logic.

**Specificity**: "Revenue up" -> "Revenue up 147%" / "Many companies" -> "1,247 companies" / "Quickly" -> "In 3 minutes"

**Benefits > Features**: "AI auto-analysis" -> "Eliminate 2 hours of daily work" / "Cloud storage" -> "Access anywhere, zero data loss risk"

### 2.4 Headline Templates

| Pattern | Template | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| How to | "How to [result]" | "How to 2x revenue in 3 months" |
| Numbers | "N [things]" | "7 habits of successful entrepreneurs" |
| Question | "Are you still [problem]?" | "Still managing with Excel?" |
| Fear | "If you don't [action], [consequence]" | "Act now or lose customers" |
| Testimony | "How [person] achieved [result]" | "How a beginner hit 1M/month in 3 months" |
| Secret | "The secret of [topic]" | "The secret top salespeople know" |
| Warning | "Read this before [action]" | "Read this before signing a SaaS contract" |

## Part 3: Funnel Design

### 3.1 Two-Step Marketing (DRM)

```
1-step:  Visitor -> Purchase          (CVR: 1-3%)
2-step:  Visitor -> Lead -> Nurture -> Purchase  (CVR: 10-30%)
                     |
                 Lead Magnet (free value)
```

**Lead Magnet Types**:

| Type | Example | Effectiveness |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Checklist | "77-item LP checklist" | High (easy to create) |
| Template | "10 copy-paste email templates" | High |
| Mini course | "3-day email course" | Medium (doubles as nurture) |
| Tool | "ROI calculator sheet" | High (practical) |
| Report | "Industry trend report" | Medium |
| Webinar | "Free webinar" | High (trust building) |

### 3.2 Frontend / Backend Strategy

```
Frontend (acquisition)    ->    Backend (revenue)
Low price / Free                High price / Recurring
Value delivery                  Core product
Trust building                  Profit capture
```

| Stage | Product | Price | Purpose |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| Free | Lead magnet | 0 | Lead capture |
| Frontend | Trial / low-price | low | Customer acquisition, trust |
| Middle | Standard plan | mid/mo | Revenue pillar |
| Backend | Premium / consulting | high | Profit maximization |

### 3.3 Email Sequence (Nurturing, 7 days)

| Day | Subject Pattern | Content | Purpose |
|-----|----------------|---------|---------|
| 0 | "Thank you for registering" | Deliver lead magnet | Value |
| 1 | "First thing to do" | Show first step | Relationship |
| 2 | "Why I started this" | Story | Empathy/trust |
| 3 | "Common mistakes" | Deepen problem | Education |
| 4 | "Success stories" | Social proof | Trust |
| 5 | "Special announcement" | Offer preview | Anticipation |
| 7 | "Last chance" | Limited offer | Action |

---

## Part 4: Launch Strategy

### 4.1 Product Launch Formula (PLF)

```
Pre-Pre Launch (2w before) -> Pre Launch (1w) -> Launch (3-7d) -> Post Launch (1w)
     Seeding                   Anticipation        Sales            Follow-up
```

| Phase | Tactics |
|-------|---------|
| **Pre-Pre Launch** | Teaser ("Something new coming"), survey, countdown |
| **Pre Launch** | Free content (videos, articles), development story, beta testimonials |
| **Launch** | Open announcement, limited offer (early discount), urgency ("72h only") |
| **Post Launch** | Onboarding support, collect testimonials, prepare upsell |

### 4.2 Live Launch (Koyama Style)

Real-time energy + two-way communication + scarcity + community feel.

**Format**: Webinar / YouTube Live / Twitter Space | 60-90 min | Value (70%) + Offer (30%)

**Webinar Structure**:

| Time | Content | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0-5m | Intro, agenda | Relationship |
| 5-15m | Problem framing, empathy | Pain confirmation |
| 15-40m | Solution, knowledge delivery | Value, trust |
| 40-50m | Success stories, testimonials | Social proof |
| 50-60m | Offer, Q&A | Action |

## Part 5: Referral System

### 5.1 Referral Program Design (Jay Abraham)

**Conditions for referrals**: satisfied with product / incentive exists / easy mechanism to refer.

| Item | Content |
|------|---------|
| Referrer reward | e.g., 1 month free, credit |
| Referee reward | e.g., 50% off first month |
| Method | Dedicated link, referral code |
| Tracking | [define] |
| Payout timing | On registration / On payment |

### 5.2 WOW Moments (Word-of-Mouth Triggers)

| Timing | Tactic |
|--------|--------|
| First use | Onboarding "wow" experience |

| Support interaction | Exceed expectations |
| Updates | Implement requested features |

**Share mechanisms**: One-click tweet / auto-generated share images / unified hashtag.
